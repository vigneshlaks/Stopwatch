This is a simple stopwatch application built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The application allows users to start, stop, and reset a stopwatch timer with millisecond precision.

## Features

- Start/Stop/Reset functionality for the stopwatch timer
- Displays the elapsed time in the format `HH:MM:SS:ms`
- Clean and user-friendly interface with intuitive controls

## Technologies Used

- React
- JavaScript
- CSS

## Getting Started

To run this application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
4. Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.
5. After the installation is complete, run `npm start` to start the development server.
6. The application should now be running locally at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Code Structure

The main components of the application are:

- `App.jsx`: The root component that renders the `Stopwatch` component.
- `Stopwatch.jsx`: The main component that handles the stopwatch functionality and renders the display and controls.

The `Stopwatch` component uses React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`) to manage the component's state and side effects. It also includes helper functions for formatting the elapsed time and handling the start, stop, and reset actions.

The application's styles are defined in the `index.css` file, which includes styles for the overall layout, stopwatch display, and control buttons.
